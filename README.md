# The-Python-Launcher-and-Restarter
Python code that can launch a program such as excel file and restart the program under some circumstances

I have already achieved to create script that will check for defined errors, in case of error it will kill excel and restart the macro

What I struggle to achieve is to create a master file that will launch the macro for the first time and at the same time it will launch the "Check for errors" script.
